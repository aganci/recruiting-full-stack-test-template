# 1000farmacie's fullstack recruiting test

Build a Ruby on Rails application to handle an e-commerce platform. The test consist on a reduced scope of a larger system.
It's requested to build views, models and logics for:
- product page: it's mandatory to handle product name, description, image and price
- cart page: it's mandatory to handle cart item list and total price

We prefer usage of TailwindCSS, ERB, Turbo and Stimulus as the standard Rails way.

A base application with models is provided, complete of RSpec tests, it's asked to extend it implementing the points above. Only the unstyled product listing page is provided.

As per styling, it's up to you to decide what will be the style of the e-commerce. There are no strong requirements and it can also be a very simple design, evaluation will be lightweight on the final style result.

Page responsiveness is a plus.
